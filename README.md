Day 1: HTML Basics:


1. Introduction to HTML
What is HTML?

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create webpages. It defines the structure and content of a webpage.

Real-Life Example:
Think of HTML as the blueprint of a house. Just like a blueprint outlines the structure of a building, HTML outlines the structure of a webpage.

Basic Structure of an HTML Document:


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Webpage</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>

Explanation:
<!DOCTYPE html>: Declares the document type and version of HTML.
<html>: The root element of the HTML page.
<head>: Contains meta-information about the document, like the title.
<title>: Sets the title of the webpage (visible on the browser tab).
<body>: Contains the content of the webpage that is visible to users.
<h1>: Defines the main heading of the page.
<p>: Defines a paragraph.

2. Common HTML Tags

Headings:
HTML offers six levels of headings, from <h1> to <h6>, where <h1> is the most important and <h6> is the least.
html

<h1>Main Heading</h1>
<h2>Subheading</h2>
Paragraphs:

Use the <p> tag to define paragraphs.

 
<p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
Links:

Use the <a> tag to create hyperlinks.

 
<a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example.com</a>
Images:

Use the <img> tag to display images.

<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of image">

2. Lists
Types of Lists:

Ordered Lists (<ol>): Numbered lists.
Unordered Lists (<ul>): Bulleted lists.

 
<ol>
    <li>First item</li>
    <li>Second item</li>
</ol>

<ul>
    <li>Bullet item 1</li>
    <li>Bullet item 2</li>
</ul>

3. Forms
Creating a Basic Form:

 
<form action="/submit" method="post">
    <label for="name">Name:</label>
    <input type="text" id="name" name="name">

@media (max-width: 600px) {
  .container {
      width: 100%;
  }
}
Interview Question:

How do you make a website responsive using HTML and CSS?
Answer:

Use the viewport meta tag and CSS media queries to adjust the layout and style based on the device's screen size.

6. Custom Data Attributes
Why It's Important:

Custom data attributes (data-*) allow you to store extra information on HTML elements without cluttering the HTML with non-standard attributes.
Example:

html
 
<div data-user-id="12345">User Name</div>
<script>
    var userId = document.querySelector('div').dataset.userId;
    console.log(userId); // Outputs: 12345
</script>
Interview Question:

HTML Interview Questions and Best Answers :

1. What is the difference between HTML and HTML5?

Answer: HTML is the standard markup language used to create web pages, while HTML5 is the latest version that introduces new features like semantic elements (<header>, <footer>), multimedia elements (<audio>, <video>), new APIs (Canvas, Geolocation), and better support for mobile devices.

2. What are semantic HTML elements, and why are they important?

Answer: Semantic HTML elements clearly describe their meaning in a human- and machine-readable way. Examples include <article>, <section>, and <nav>. They improve accessibility, SEO, and code readability.

3. How do you ensure that your web pages are accessible?

Answer: To ensure accessibility, use semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, proper alt text for images, keyboard navigability, and responsive design. Testing with screen readers and other assistive technologies is also crucial.

4. What is the difference between id and class in HTML?

Answer: id is a unique identifier for a single element, used for one-time styling or scripting. class is a reusable identifier that can be applied to multiple elements, useful for applying the same style to multiple elements.

5. What is the purpose of the doctype declaration in HTML?

Answer: The doctype declaration informs the browser about the HTML version being used, enabling it to render the page correctly. For HTML5, the declaration is <!DOCTYPE html>.

6. How do you optimize an HTML page for SEO?

Answer: Optimize HTML for SEO by using semantic tags, proper heading structures (<h1> to <h6>), meta tags (like description and keywords), alt text for images, and structured data (like microdata or JSON-LD).

7. What are custom data attributes, and how are they used?

Answer: Custom data attributes (data-*) allow you to store extra information on HTML elements. They are accessed using JavaScript via element.dataset and are useful for storing data that is private to the page or application.

8. What is the difference between <section> and <div>?

Answer: <section> is a semantic element used to group related content that forms a distinct part of a document, such as a chapter or a group of articles. <div> is a generic container with no specific meaning, often used for styling or scripting purposes.

9. How does the viewport meta tag contribute to responsive web design?

Answer: The viewport meta tag controls the layout on mobile browsers by setting the width, initial scale, and other properties. It ensures that web pages are displayed correctly on different devices.

10. Explain the use of HTML5â€™s localStorage and sessionStorage.

Answer: localStorage and sessionStorage are HTML5 features that store key-value pairs in the browser. localStorage persists data even after the browser is closed, while sessionStorage clears data when the session ends (browser tab is closed).

11. What are void elements in HTML? Provide examples.

Answer: Void elements are HTML elements that do not have a closing tag. Examples include <img>, <br>, <hr>, and <input>.

12. How does the <picture> element work in HTML5?

Answer: The <picture> element allows developers to define multiple sources for an image, enabling responsive images based on device capabilities or screen size. It uses the <source> tag within <picture> to specify different image files.

13. What is the purpose of the alt attribute in an <img> tag?

Answer: The alt attribute provides alternative text for an image, which is displayed if the image cannot be loaded. It also improves accessibility for screen readers and contributes to SEO.

14. Explain the difference between block-level and inline elements.

Answer: Block-level elements, like <div>, <p>, and <h1>, start on a new line and take up the full width available. Inline elements, like <span>, <a>, and <strong>, do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary.

15. How can you include external resources like CSS and JavaScript in an HTML document?

Answer: External CSS can be linked using the <link> tag within the <head> section, and external JavaScript can be included using the <script> tag, typically at the end of the <body> or within the <head> with the defer attribute.
These questions and answers cover essential HTML concepts that are commonly asked in interviews and demonstrate a strong understanding of web development fundamentals.
